    <h2>INSPIRING COMPUTER ENGINEER JOURNEY TO COMPUTER SCIENCE</h2>
    <h3>Welcome To My First Website!!!</h3>
    <p>Here you will learn about my journey from a Computer Engineering background, to my new found passion for Computer Science.
        <br>We will walk throught my expirencess and projects I've completed in the past, to my current projects.
        <br>I love to share my expirences, coming from a CE major to transitioning to Computer Science is very intimidating. But I'm ready for the challenge!
    </p>
    <p>I am a first generation college graduate with a computer engineering degree. Being the first in my family to attend university also means my work ethic is unmatched. 
        <br>I take initiative in every task I'm faced with. Using my background as an engineer to better adapt to challenges we face on a day to day basis and enjoy the experience it comes with. 
        <br>I enjoy working with numbers and finding solutions to intricate problems. In addition, working with others and being a unit to a common goal ultimately makes me feel  
        <br>Iâ€™m contributing to a successful team. Engineering helps me see challenges and problems through different angles than most people,  
        <br>not just in computer science but in the world we live in as well. I am developing technical skills and strategies to implement into the workforce which would make me a valuable candidate.
