<h2>Get To Know Me!</h2>

<p>
        I’m a natural born leader, I take initiative and action regardless of the obstacles I am confronted with. I believe being a leader  
    <br>has a lot more to do with how I capitalize off of my team's strengths and weaknesses, in order to synergize my team’s energy to  
    <br>complete a common goal; With that being said, It goes without saying I’m a workaholic and love to find solutions to complex problems. 
    <br>I seek to better the needs of others, helping others makes me feel like I'm contributing to society and aiding others. 
    <br>Regardless if it is mentally or financially.
</p>
<p>
        At an early age my mother has taught me to keep a positive scope of lens to overcome barriers. I am willing to empathize with others and  
    <br>their respective experiences to support them best as possible. Through finance, I have the potential to support others to reach their 
    <br>long term goals, being able to enforce others financially provides me satisfactory. I want to educate others on how important 
    <br>financial literacy is and how It can change the whole spectrum of their family tree, starting simply with yourself.
